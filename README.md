# Term suggestion coding kata

## Developpement process

According to the statement of problem 1 ` Suggestions de terme `, I will proceed in the following :

- Using the ` TDD ` approach,
- I've asked Claude code to generate the unit tests for the Angular service ` TermSuggestionService ` that I will be implementing as solution for the given problem (I'm doing this to rely on the AI for the ability to fully test all the possible cases)
- I've generated the project in ` Angular v21 ` and accordingly to the CLI, I'm using ` Vitest ` as test runner.

For further details, refer to the Angular ` web ` project inside this repository.
